^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Language plugins enable the users to write the implementation of specs in a language of their choice. 

.. _install-language-runner:

.. tab-container:: languages

    .. tab:: CSharp

        .. code-block:: console

            gauge install csharp

Verify your installation
------------------------

Check the version of your plugin and Gauge core by running:

.. code-block:: console

   gauge version

The output should look like:

.. code-block:: console

   Gauge version: <version number>

   Plugins
   -------
   plugin(<version number>)

You can read more about plugins :doc:`here <plugins>`.

After Gauge and a language runner is installed, see :ref:`create a Gauge project <create_a_project>`.

Gauge provides some templates to help setup a project. Follow the instructions for the respective language below.

.. tab-container:: languages

    .. tab:: CSharp

        .. code-block:: console

            gauge init csharp

    .. tab:: Java

The console should print a message ``Successfully initialized the project``. 
Follow further instructions on the console to proceed with execution.

Refer :ref:`project_structure` for files that get created for all languages.
