:heading:`Configure Gauge`
==========================
.. include:: ./partials/change_filter.rst

You can configure Gauge as per your requirements by using key value pairs in the ``gauge.properties`` and ``default.properties`` files. 


The global key value pairs, in the ``gauge.properties`` file, allow you to configure Gauge across all Gauge projects. 
For example, you can change the timeout value of Gauge when Gauge connects to plugins by changing the value of the ``plugin_connection_timeout`` key. This value applies to all Gauge projects.  


The local key value pairs, in the ``default.properties`` file, allow you to configure Gauge for a particular Gauge project.
For example, you can have separate Gauge reports or a single, new, time-stamped directory created (overwrite previous report) every time Gauge runs a specification by using the ``overwrite_reports`` key.


.. note::

   You can open the ``.properties`` file by using any text editor.

.. _global_configuration_Gauge:

Global configuration of Gauge (``gauge.properties``)
----------------------------------------------------
``gauge.properties`` is a ``.properties`` file that contains all Gauge specific configurations. 
You can use or change the key value pairs present in this file to configure Gauge across all 
Gauge projects. This file is located at ``~/.gauge/config`` in macOS and Linux systems and 
at ``%APPDATA%\gauge\config`` in Windows systems.

You can also use the ``gauge config`` command to change the value of a key in the ``gauge.properties`` file.

.. code-block:: console

   gauge config [flags] [args]

.. cssclass:: example

Example

For example, to change the value of ``check_updates`` in ``gauge.properties``, use the command in the following way:

.. code-block:: console

   gauge config check_updates false

This changes the value of the key, ``check_updates``, to ``false``.

The list of key value pairs present in ``gauge.properties`` are listed as follows:

.. code-block:: gauge
    :linenos:
    :name: gauge_properties

    # Allow Gauge and its plugin updates to be notified to the user.
    check_updates = true

    # Set to a URL, which acts as plugin repository for Gauge.
    gauge_repository_url = https://downloads.gauge.org/plugin

    # Set to a URL, which acts as a template repository for Gauge.
    gauge_templates_url = https://downloads.gauge.org/templates

    # Timeout in milliseconds for requests from language 
    # runner when connecting to IDE.
    ide_request_timeout = 30000

    # Sets the timeout in milliseconds for Gauge while
    # connecting to plugins (except language runner plugins).
    plugin_connection_timeout = 10000

    # Sets the timeout in milliseconds for a plugin to stop
    # after a kill message has been sent.
    plugin_kill_timeout = 10000

    # Sets the timeout in milliseconds for Gauge while
    # connecting to the language runner.
    runner_connection_timeout = 30000

    # Sets the timeout in milliseconds for requests from the
    # language runner to Gauge.
    # If the size of the Gauge project is too big, Gauge might time out before the
    # language runner returns the response message.
    runner_request_timeout = 10000


.. _local_configuration_Gauge:

Local configuration of Gauge (``default.properties``)
-----------------------------------------------------
``default.properties`` is a ``.properties`` file that contains *key value* pairs. You can use or change the key value pairs present in this file to configure a particular Gauge project. The changed value overrides the default value of a key.  
This file is located at ``<project_root>/env/default``, where ``<project_root>`` is the location at which you have created your Gauge project.

The list of key value pairs present in ``default.properties`` are listed as follows:

.. code-block:: gauge
    :linenos:
    :name: default_properties

    # The path to the gauge reports directory should be either relative to
    # the project directory or an absolute path.
    gauge_reports_dir = reports

    # Set as false if gauge reports should not be overwritten 
    # when Gauge runs a specification.
    # If set to true, a new, time-stamped directory is 
    # created every time when Gauge runs a specification.
    overwrite_reports = true

    # Set to false to disable screenshots on failure in Gauge reports.
    screenshot_on_failure = true

    # The path to the Gauge logs directory should be either relative to the
    # project directory or an absolute path.
    logs_directory = logs

    # Set to true to use multithreading for parallel execution
    enable_multithreading = false

    # The path to the gauge specifications directory. 
    # Takes a comma separated list of specification files or directories.
    gauge_specs_dir = specs

    # CsvDelimiter holds delimiter used to parse csv files
    # default: `,`
    csv_delimiter = ,

    # Allows steps to be written in multiline
    allow_multiline_step = false


.. _language_config:

Language plugin configurations
------------------------------
``<language>.properties`` is the ``.properties`` file corresponding to the language plugin that you have used while creating a Gauge project.  
Configuration properties set in these files are available as environment variables when Gauge runs a specification. You can use these properties or change them as per your requirements.

.. note::
  ``<language>.properties`` file is automatically created when a Gauge project is created and initialized with a language of your choice.

You can find the language specific ``.properties`` file at ``<project_root>/env/default/<language>.properties``, where ``<project_root>`` is the location at which you have created the Gauge project.

For example, if you have installed Java on your system, then the path of the ``.properties`` file is ``<project_root>/env/default/java.properties``.

For more details about running language plugins as an environment, see :ref:`Environments <environments>`.

.. cssclass:: dynamic-content java

    If you have installed Java, then you can  make Java specific configuration changes in the ``java.properties`` file. 
    The following key value pairs are listed in ``java.properties``:

    .. code-block:: gauge
        :linenos:
        :name: java.properties

        # Specify an alternate Java home if you want to use a custom version of the Java Development Kit (JDK).
        gauge_java_home = PATH_TO_JAVA_HOME

        # Use this property if you need to override the build path for the Gauge project.
        # IntelliJ Idea and Eclipse out directory are usually auto-detected.
        gauge_custom_build_path = PATH_TO_CUSTOM_BUILDPATH

        # Specify the directory where additional libraries are kept.
        # You can specify multiple directory names separated with a comma `,`
        # `libs` directory in the gauge project is added by default.
        gauge_additional_libs = libs/*, PATH_TO_NEW_LIBRARY

        # Specify the JVM arguments passed to Java while launching.
        # Enter multiple values separated by comma (,). For example, Xmx1024m, Xms128m
        gauge_jvm_args = <JVM_ARGS>

        # Specify the directory containing Java files to be compiled.
        # You can specify multiple directory names separated with a comma (,).
        gauge_custom_compile_dir =

        # Specify the level at which the in-memory objects should be cleared
        # Possible values are suite, spec, and scenario. Default value is scenario.
        gauge_clear_state_level = scenario

.. cssclass:: dynamic-content javascript

    If you have installed JavaScript, then you can make JavaScript specific configuration changes in the ``js.properties`` file. 
    The following key value pairs are listed in ``js.properties``:

    .. code-block:: gauge
        :linenos:
        :name: js.properties

        # Use this property if you need to override the timeout of a step when Gauge runs the step in a specification.
        test_timeout = 10000

        # Change this to true to enable browser debugging support
        DEBUG = false

        # Comma separated list of directories or paths (a path should be relative to project root).
        STEP_IMPL_DIR = tests

.. cssclass:: dynamic-content python

    If you have installed Python, then you can make Python specific configuration changes in the ``python.properties`` file. 
    The following key value pair is listed in ``python.properties``:

    .. code-block:: gauge
        :linenos:
        :name: python

        # Comma separated list of dirs. path should be relative to project root.
        STEP_IMPL_DIR = tests

.. cssclass:: dynamic-content csharp

    If you have installed Csharp, then you can make Csharp specific configuration changes in the ``csharp.properties`` file. 
    The following key value pair is listed in ``csharp.properties``:

    .. code-block:: gauge
        :linenos:
        :name: csharp

        # Holds the location of the created Gauge project
        GAUGE_CSHARP_PROJECT_FILE = SampleCsharp.csproj

        # The build configuration when running tests for the Gauge project
        GAUGE_CSHARP_PROJECT_CONFIG = Debug

        # The build platform when running tests for the Gauge project
        GAUGE_CSHARP_PROJECT_PLATFORM = Any CPU

        # Specify the level at which the in-memory objects should be cleared
        # Possible values are suite, spec, and scenario. Default value is scenario.
        gauge_clear_state_level = scenario

.. cssclass:: dynamic-content ruby

If you have installed Ruby, then you can make Ruby specific configuration changes in the ``ruby.properties`` file.
Ruby do not have any specific default configuration properties of its own currently. 


HTTP_PROXY setting while using Gauge
------------------------------------

Gauge connects to the internet for downloading plugins and templates. If
you are behind a proxy, you must configure the proxy settings so
that Gauge connects to the internet via the proxy server.

Without Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If authentication is not required, set the environment variable
``HTTP_PROXY`` to proxy server URL.


.. cssclass:: dynamic-content macos
.. code-block:: console

    export HTTP_PROXY=http://server-ip:port

.. cssclass:: dynamic-content linux
.. code-block:: console

    export HTTP_PROXY=http://server-ip:port

.. cssclass:: dynamic-content windows`
.. code-block:: console

    set HTTP_PROXY=http://server-ip:port

With Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If authentication is required, set the environment variable
``HTTP_PROXY`` to proxy server URL along with the credentials.

.. cssclass:: dynamic-content macos
.. code-block:: console

    export HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@server-ip:port

.. cssclass:: dynamic-content linux
.. code-block:: console

    export HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@server-ip:port

.. cssclass:: dynamic-content windows`
.. code-block:: console

    set HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@server-ip:port


Gauge configuration while using build tools
-------------------------------------------
If you are using Gauge with the build tools such as Maven or Gradle, then you must be aware of specific configuration properties.

* For configuration information while using Gauge with Maven, see Gauge Maven Plugin  `repository <https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-maven-plugin/blob/master/README.md>`__.
* For configuration information while using Gauge with Gradle, see Gauge Gradle Plugin `repository  <https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-gradle-plugin/blob/master/Readme.md>`__.

.. _environments:

Using environments in a Gauge project
-------------------------------------

Environment specific variables can be managed by using property files. The property files have a set of *key value* pairs which are set as environment variables when Gauge runs a specification.
Gauge allows you to create groups of property files by defining an environment.

A Gauge project can have multiple environments. ``default`` is the default environment.  
Gauge uses the ``–env`` flag to load an environment, when Gauge runs a specification. If ``–env`` is not specified, then the ``default`` environment is chosen during run time. 
Multiple environments can be specified along with the ``–env`` flag.

.. cssclass:: example

Example

The following example shows an ``env`` directory structure for a Java project.  
``default.properties`` and ``java.properties`` are the ``.properties`` files created when you create a Gauge project with Java as the language runner. 
You can use or change the key value pairs in these ``.properties`` files as per your requirements.


.. code-block:: text

    ├── env
      └── default
         ├── default.properties
         └── java.properties

.. attention::
   You can either create a new ``.properties`` file or use an existing file to add your custom key value pairs.

Create a new environment in a Gauge project
-------------------------------------------

For ease of testing, you can create an environment in addition to the ``default`` 
existing environment in your Gauge project. You can create a new ``.properties`` file or add 
an existing property file to this new environment and customize the configuration properties 
as per your requirements.

.. admonition:: Before you begin

   Ensure that you have created and initialized a Gauge project with a language runner of your choice.

.. admonition:: About this task
   
   A Gauge project can have multiple environments.
   
   ``default`` is the default environment.

Create a directory in the ``env`` folder of your Gauge project. The environment folder is 
present at ``<project_root>``, where ``project_root`` is the location at which you have created 
your Gauge project.

.. code-block:: console

    mkdir <name_of_env>

.. cssclass:: example

Example


Create an environment called ``ci``.

.. code-block:: console

    mkdir ci
   
A ``ci`` environment is created at ``<project_root>/env``.

If you want to add your own key value pairs, then create a ``.properties`` file within the newly created environment.

.. note::
   
   You can also add or change the key value pairs in an existing ``.properties`` file and use this file in your newly created environment.
   You can add any number of ``.properties`` file to your environment.

.. cssclass:: example

Example

The following example shows multiple environments in a Gauge project, where ``env`` is located at ``<project_root>``.
``ci``, ``dev``, and ``experimental`` are newly created environments in addition to the already existing ``default`` environment.
The ``default`` environment is created when you create and initialize a Gauge project.
``ci`` and ``dev`` have newly created ``user.properties`` file, whereas ``experimental`` has ``default.properties`` and ``java.properties``, which are already existing files.

.. code-block:: text

    ├── env
       ├── ci
          |── user.properties
       |── default
          ├── default.properties
          └── java.properties
       ├── dev
          |── user.properties    
       ├── experimental
          |── default.properties    
          └── java.properties

For more information about language plugin configurations, see :ref:`Language plugin configuration <language_config>` .

Run a Gauge specification with an environment
---------------------------------------------

You can use the ``-env`` flag to load an environment when Gauge runs a specification. 
During run time, the key value pairs that you have used in the ``.properties`` file are set as environment variables. 
If ``-env`` is not specified, then the ``default`` environment is loaded during run time.

.. admonition:: Before you begin
   
   Ensure that you have the Gauge specification that needs to be run.
   
   You must have already created the environment and added the ``.properties`` file in this environment.

Use the following command at ``<project_root>`` (location at which you have created the Gauge project) to run a 
Gauge specification with an environment:


You can use the ``-env`` flag to load an environment when Gauge runs a specification. 
During run time, the key value pairs that you have used in the ``.properties`` file are set as environment variables. 
If ``-env`` is not specified, then the ``default`` environment is loaded during run time.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --env <name_of_env> specs

``<name_of_env>`` - name of the environment that you choose to load

.. cssclass:: example

Example

In the following example, the ``ci`` environment is loaded when Gauge runs a specification.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --env ci specs

.. Provide cross references to run a gauge specification file

Run a Gauge specification with multiple environments
----------------------------------------------------

You can load multiple environments by using the ``-env`` flag when Gauge runs a specification. 
This allows ease of testing.

.. admonition:: Before you begin
   
   Ensure that you have the Gauge specification that needs to be run.
   
   You must have already created the environments and added the ``.properties`` file in these environments.

.. admonition:: About this task

   Gauge loads the environment variables as per the rules of precedence.
   If there are common environment variables in a user-created environment and the ``default`` environment, then the ``default`` environment does not overwrite those variables which are already loaded from the user-created environment.
   If the ``default`` environment is not specified explicitly as an argument to the ``--env`` flag, then Gauge automatically adds ``default`` at the end of the arguments list. 

   For more information about the precedence of environments, see :ref:`Precedence of environments <precedence_environments>`.

Use the following command at ``<project_root>`` (location at which you have created the Gauge project) to run a 
Gauge specification with multiple environments:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --env "<name_of_env_1>, <name_of_env_2>, default" specs

``<name_of_env_1,2>`` - names of the environments that you choose to load

.. cssclass:: example

Example

In the following example, ``ci``, ``experimental``, and ``default`` environments are loaded when Gauge runs a specification.

.. code-block:: console
   
   gauge run --env "ci, experimental, default" specs

As per the rules of precedence, environment variables from ``ci`` are set first, followed by ``experimental``, and then ``default``.

.. cssclass:: example

Example

In the following example, environment variables from ``ci`` are set first, followed by ``default``, and then ``experimental``.

.. code-block:: console

   gauge run –env “ ci, default, experimental” specs

.. cssclass:: example

Example

In the following example, though ``default`` environment is not explicitly specified as an argument to ``--env``, Gauge automatically adds this environment at the end of the list, which is after ``experimental``.

.. code-block:: console

   gauge run –env “ ci, experimental” specs


.. _precedence_environments:

Precedence of environments when running Gauge
---------------------------------------------

If multiple environments are loaded when Gauge runs a specification, then Gauge follows the rules of precedence to load the environment variables as provided by the user and from the ``default`` environment. 
It is recommended that you understand these rules to run your tests effectively.

The rules of precedence to load the environment variables are as follows:

* Environment variables provided in the user shell of the user’s operating system.
* Environment variables (from the environments) provided by the user in the ``--env`` flag.
* Environment variables from ``gauge.properties`` (global configuration of Gauge; located at ``<project_root>/env``).
* Environment variables from the ``default`` environment.
  
.. note::

    If the ``default`` environment is not present, Gauge internally sets the environment variables which have the same value as mentioned in ``default.properties``.
  
Gauge workflow with multiple environments
-----------------------------------------

When Gauge is run with multiple environments, the following events occur:

1. Gauge loads the environment variables set at the operating system's user shell.
2. Gauge loads the environment variables from the environments provided by the user in the ``--env`` flag.
   
   .. attention::
      If the environment mentioned in the ``--env`` flag is not found at  ``<project_root>/env``, Gauge ends with a non-zero exit code.

3. Next, Gauge loads the environment variables from ``gauge.properties`` (global configuration).
   
   .. important::
      Only those variables that are not yet set are loaded.

4. Lastly, Gauge loads the default environment variables as follows: 

   * If the ``default`` directory is not present at ``<project_root>/env``, Gauge internally sets the environment variables as mentioned in ``default.properties`` (local configuration).
   * If ``default`` is located at ``<project_root>/env``, Gauge loads the environment variables from ``default.properties``. 

   .. important::
      Only those variables that are not yet set are loaded.

For more information about global configuration, see :ref:`Global configuration of Gauge <global_configuration_Gauge>`.
For more information about local configuration, see :ref:`Local configuration of Gauge <local_configuration_Gauge>`.


Examples of Gauge workflows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some of the possible Gauge workflows are listed on this page for your understanding.

Workflow : User runs ``gauge run specs``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``default`` environment is located at <project_root>/env/.

* If ``default`` is **not** present, Gauge internally sets the environment variables with the same values as mentioned in ``default.properties`` (local configuration).
* If ``default`` is present, Gauge sets the environment variables as mentioned in the ``default`` environment. 
  
For more information about local configuration, see :ref:`Local configuration of Gauge <local_configuration_Gauge>`.

Workflow : User runs ``gauge run --env java_ci specs``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``java_ci`` is the user-created environment at ``<project_root>/env``.

* If ``java_ci`` is **not** found, Gauge ends with a non-zero exit code.
* If ``java_ci`` is present, Gauge sets the environment variables mentioned in the ``java_ci`` environment.
  Gauge then loads other environment variables from the ``default`` environment which are not yet set.
  If the ``default`` environment is not present, Gauge internally sets the environment variables, which is the same as those in ``default.properties``.

Workflow : User runs ``gauge_reports_dir=newReportsDir gauge run specs``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
   Alternately, user can explicitly set ``gauge_reports_dir=newReportsDir`` in the operating system's user shell and then run ``gauge run specs``.

``default`` environment is located at <project_root>/env/.

Gauge sets all the environment variables from ``default``.
If ``default`` is not present, Gauge internally sets the environment variables, which is the same as those in ``default.properities``, except for ``gauge_reports_dir``.

The value of ``gauge_reports_dir`` continues to be ``newReportsDir``.

Workflow : User runs ``gauge_reports_dir=newReportsDir gauge run --env=java_ci specs``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``java_ci`` is the user-created environment at ``<project_root>/env``.

.. note::
   Alternately, user can explicitly set ``gauge_reports_dir=newReportsDir`` in the operating system's user shell and then run ``gauge run --env java_ci specs``

Gauge sets the environment variables as mentioned in the ``java_ci`` environment except for ``gauge_reports_dir``.
The value of ``gauge_reports_dir`` continues to be ``newReportsDir``.

Workflow : User runs ``gauge_reports_dir=newReportsDir gauge run --env “java_ci, experimental” specs``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``java_ci, experimental`` are the user-created environments at ``<project_root>/env``.

.. note::
   Alternately, user can explicitly set ``gauge_reports_dir=newReportsDir`` in the operating system's user shell and then run ``gauge run --env "java_ci, experimental" specs``

* If either one of the user-created environment is not found, Gauge ends with a non-zero exit code.
* If all the user-created environments are present, Gauge sets the environment variables mentioned in the corresponding environments.
* Gauge then loads the environment variables, which are not yet set, from ``gauge.properties``.
* If the ``default`` environment is not specified explicitly, then Gauge automatically runs ``default`` and loads the environment variables which are not yet set.
  If ``default`` is not present, Gauge internally sets the environment variables, which is the same as ``default.properties``.

The value of ``gauge_reports_dir`` continues to be ``newReportsDir``.
