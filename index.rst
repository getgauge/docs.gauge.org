Why Gauge?
----------

The communication breakdowns between Developers and Business
Stakeholders is a common risk of software development. Gauge is an
advanced automation tool that allows requirements to be written in a way
that will be understood by all roles in a project and help bridge the
gap.

Some of the **key features** of Gauge that make it stand unique include:

-  A rich markup based on
   `markdown <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`__
-  Simple, Flexible and Rich Syntax
-  Business Language Tests : Supports the concept of `executable
   documentation <advanced_readings/living_documentation.md>`__
-  Consistent Cross Platform/Language Support for writing test code.
   Currently `supported
   languages <installations/install_language_runners.md>`__.
-  Open Source, so it could be shared freely and improved by others as
   well
-  A modular architecture with `plugin <plugins/README.md>`__ support.
-  Extensible through `plugins <plugins/README.md>`__ and Hackable
-  Supports External Data Sources
-  Helps you create Maintainable and Understandable test suites
-  `IDE Support <ide_support/README.md>`__
