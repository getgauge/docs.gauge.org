Execution
=========

Specify Directory
-----------------

By convention, specifications are stored in the the ``./specs/`` 
sub-directory in the project root.Gauge scans the directory(ies) passed 
and picks up valid specification files.

Multiple arguments can be passed to ``run`` subcommand by separating them with a space. 
The values can be either

- path to directories that contain specifications 
- path to specification files
- path to scenarios (see :ref:`scenario <scenario_syntax>`)
- mix of above.

To run all the specifications in a given folder ``specs``:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs


To specify a single directory in which specifications are stored:

For example,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/

To specify multiple directories in which specifications are
stored. 

For example,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs-dir1/ specs-dir2/ specs-dir3/

.. note::
    The path of specifications can also be specified through an environment variable <path>.
    This changes the default specification directory from ``specs`` to the value defined in the environment variable. 

.. note::
    Gauge specifications can also be run from within the IDE
    (`Visual Studio Code <https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-vscode/blob/master/README.md#run-specifications-and-scenarios>`__,
    `IntelliJ IDEA <https://github.com/getgauge/Intellij-Plugin/blob/master/README.md#execution>`__, Visual Studio)

Specify files
-------------

Gauge executes only the specification file(s) provided.

Run one (or a list of) specifications.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run [flags] <path-to-specs>

For example, execute a single specification file:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/spec1.spec

Or, execute multiple specification files:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/spec1.spec specs/spec2.spec specs/spec3.spec

Specify Scenarios
-----------------

A single scenario of a specification can be executed by specifying the
line number in the span of that scenario in the spec. 
The argument can be a specific :ref:`scenario <scenario_syntax>` or a 
list of scenarios to execute. 

To execute a ``Admin Login`` scenario in the following spec use
``gauge run specs/login_test.spec:4`` command.

.. code-block:: gauge
    :linenos:
    :name: specify_scenario
    :emphasize-lines: 3-5

    # Configuration    

    ## Admin Login
    * User must login as "admin"
    * Navigate to the configuration page

This executes only the scenario present at line number ``3`` i.e
``Admin Login`` in ``login_test.spec``. In the above spec, specifying
line numbers 3-5 will execute the same scenario because of the span.

Multiple scenarios can be executed selectively as follows :

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/helloworld.spec:3 specs/anotherhelloworld.spec:5

These scenarios can also belong to different specifications.

To execute scenarios, ``gauge`` takes path to a specification file, 
followed by a colon and the line number of the scenario. 
Any line number which the scenario spans across can be used. 

For example, in the above spec file, both the below 
commands will run the same scenario.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/helloworld.spec:3 # Runs scenario 'Admin Login'
    gauge run specs/helloworld.spec:5 # Runs scenario 'Admin Login'

Consider a specification file, ``spec1.spec``:

.. code-block:: gauge
    :linenos:
    :name: specify_multiple_scenarios
    :emphasize-lines: 3-5

    # Configuration    

    ## Admin Login
    * User must login as "admin"
    * Navigate to the configuration page

    ## User Login
    * User must login as "user1"
    * Navigation to configuration page is restricted.

To execute the second scenario of a specification file
named ``spec1.spec``:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/spec1.spec:7

To specify multiple scenarios, add multiple such arguments. For example,
to execute the first and second scenarios of a specification file named
``spec1.spec``:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run specs/spec1.spec:3 specs/spec1.spec:7

Verbose reporting
-----------------

By default, ``gauge`` reports at the specification level when executing
tests. Enable verbose step-level reporting by using the
``--verbose`` flag. For example,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --verbose specs/


.. _table_driven_execution:

Data driven execution
---------------------
-  A *data table* is defined in markdown table format in the beginning
   of the spec before any steps.
-  The data table should have a header row and one or more data rows
-  The header names from the table can be used in the steps within
   angular brackets ``< >`` to refer a particular column from the data
   table as a parameter.
-  On execution each scenario will be executed for every data row from
   the table.
-  Table can be easily created in IDE using template
   ``table:<no of columns>``, and hit ``Tab``.
-  Table parameters are written in Multi-markdown table formats.

For example,

.. code-block:: gauge
    :linenos:
    :name: data_driven

    # Table driven execution

         |id| name    |
         |--|---------|
         |1 |vishnu   |
         |2 |prateek  |
         |3 |navaneeth|

    ## Scenario
    * Say "hello" to <name>

    ## Second Scenario
    * Say "namaste" to <name>

In the above example the step uses the ``name`` column from the data
table as a dynamic parameter.

Both ``Scenario`` and ``Second Scenario`` are executed first for the
first row values ``1, vishnu`` and then consecutively for the second and
third row values from the table.

External CSV for data table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data Tables for a specification can also be passed from an external CSV file. 
The parameter contains a prefix table and the path to the csv file.

**Prefix** : The prefix is table

**Value** : The value is the path to the csv file. This can be absolute file path or relative to project.


For example,

.. code-block:: gauge
    :linenos:
    :name: data_driven_external

    # Table driven execution

    table: /system/users.csv

    ## Scenario
    * Say "hello" to <name>

    ## Second Scenario
    * Say "namaste" to <name>


In the above example the step uses the ``name`` column from the csv file.

Execute selected data table rows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, scenarios in a spec are run against all the data table rows.
It can be run against selected data table rows with flag
``--table-rows`` and specifying the row numbers against which the
scenarios should be executed. If there are multiple row numbers, they
should be separated by commas.

For example,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --table-rows "1" specs/hello.spec
    gauge run --table-rows "1,4,7" specs/hello.spec

Range of table rows can also be specified, against which the scenarios
are run.

For example,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --table-rows "1-3" specs/hello.spec

This executes the scenarios against table rows 1, 2, 3.

.. note::

    This flag does not work well for multiple specifications, since there is no way to choose 
    different table rows for different specifications.

.. _tagged_execution:

Specify Tags
------------

Tags allow filtering the specs and scenarios to be executed.
The following command executes all the specs and scenarios which are labelled with certain
tags:

.. _tag_syntax:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --tags "tag1, tag2" specs

This executes only the scenarios and specifications which are tagged
with ``tag1`` and ``tag2``.

Example:

.. code-block:: gauge
    :linenos:

    # Search Specification

    The admin user must be able to search for available products on the search page.

    Tags: search,  admin

    * User must be logged in as "admin"
    * Open the product search page

    ## Successful search

    Tags: successful

    For an existing product name, the search result will contain the product name.

    * Search for product "Die Hard"
    * "Die Hard" should show up in the search results

    ## Unsuccessful search

    On an unknown product name search, the search results will be empty

    * Search for product "unknown"
    * The search results will be empty


In the above spec, if all the scenarios tagged with "search" and "successful"
should be executed, then use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --tags "search & successful" SPEC_FILE_NAME # Runs scenario 'Successful search' only

Execution hooks can also be filtered based on tags. 
See :ref:`filtering hooks with tags <filtering_hooks_with_tags>` for more information.

Tag expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tags can be selected using expressions. Examples:

================================== ===============================================================
Tags                               Selects specs/scenarios that
================================== ===============================================================
``!TagA``                          do not have ``TagA``
``TagA & TagB`` or ``TagA,TagB``   have both ``TagA`` and ``TagB``.
``TagA & !TagB``                   have ``TagA`` and not ``TagB``.
``TagA | TagB``                    have either ``TagA`` or ``TagB``.
``(TagA & TagB) | TagC``           have either ``TagC`` or both ``TagA`` and ``TagB``
``!(TagA & TagB) | TagC``          have either ``TagC`` or do not have both TagA and TagB
``(TagA | TagB) & TagC``           have either [``TagA`` and ``TagC``] or [``TagB`` and ``TagC``]
================================== ===============================================================

.. note::

    In the command line tagged execution, the not symbol(!) has to be escaped.

.. _parallel_execution:

Parallel Execution
------------------

Specs can be executed in parallel to run the tests faster and distribute
the load.

This can be done by the command:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --parallel specs

or,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -p specs

This creates a number of execution streams depending on the number of
cores of the machine and distribute the load among workers.

The number of parallel execution streams can be specified by ``-n``
flag.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --parallel -n=4 specs

This creates four parallel execution streams.

.. note:: 
    The number of streams should be specified depending on number of CPU 
    cores available on the machine, beyond which it could lead to undesirable results. 
    For optimizations, try `parallel execution using threads`_.

.. _parallel execution using threads:

Parallel Execution using threads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In parallel execution, every stream starts a new worker process. This can be optimized 
by using multithreading instead of processes. This uses only one worker process and 
starts multiple threads for parallel execution.

To use this, Set `enable_multithreading` env var to true. 
This property can also be added to the default/custom env.

.. code-block:: text

    enable_multithreading = true

**Requirements:**

* Thread safe test code.
* Language runner should support multithreading.

.. note:: Currently, this feature is only supported by Java language runner/plugin.

Executing a group of specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Specifications can be distributed into groups and ``--group`` \| ``-g``
flag provides the ability to execute a specific group.

This can be done by the command:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 -g=2 specs

This creates 4 groups (provided by -n flag) of specification and selects
the 2nd group (provided by -g flag) for execution.

Specifications are sorted by alphabetical order and then distributed
into groups, which guarantees that every group will have the same set of
specifications, no matter how many times it is being executed.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 -g=2 specs

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 -g=2 specs

The above two commands will execute the same group of specifications.

Rerun one execution stream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Executing specs with ``-n`` and `--g`` flags guarantee the same execution. 

Example, execute the below command twice:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 -g=2 specs

On both occassions, gauge will execute the same group of specifications, in the same order.


Run your test suite with lazy assignment of tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This features dynamically allocates specs to streams during execution instead 
of at the start of execution.

This allows Gauge to optimise the resources on your agent/execution
environment. This is useful because some specs may take much longer than
other, either because of the number of scenarios in them or the nature
of the feature under test

The following command will assign tests lazily across the specified
number of streams:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 --strategy="lazy" specs

or,

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 specs

As an example, if there are 100 tests, which have to be run across 4
streams/cores; lazy assignment will dynamically assign the next spec 
in line to the stream that has completed it's previous execution and 
is waiting for more work.

Lazy assignment of tests is the default behaviour.

Another strategy called ``eager`` can also be useful depending on need.
In this case, the 100 tests are distributed before execution, thus
making them an equal number based distribution.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run -n=4 --strategy="eager" specs

.. note:: 
    The 'lazy' assignment strategy only works when you do NOT use
    the -g flag. This is because grouping is dependent on allocation of
    tests before the start of execution. Using this in conjunction with a
    lazy strategy will have no impact on your test suite execution.


Re-run failed tests
-------------------

Gauge provides the ability to re-run only the scenarios which failed
in previous execution. Failed scenarios can be run using the
``--failed`` flag of Gauge.

As an example if 3 scenarios failed during ``gauge run specs`` , the failed scenarios can be re-run
instead of executing all scenarios by following command.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --failed

This command will even set the flags which you had provided in your
previous run. For example, if previous command was

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --env="chrome" --verbose specs

and 3 scenarios failed in this run, the ``gauge run --failed`` command sets
the ``--env`` and ``--verbose`` flags to corresponding values and
executes only the 3 failed scenarios. In this case ``gauge run --failed`` is
equivalent to command

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --env="chrome" --verbose specs <path_to_failed_scenarios>

Re-run flaky tests with max retry
---------------------------------

Gauge provides a way to retry tests which may have failed.
The failed tests can be retry using following command.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --max-retries-count=3

This command will retry a failed test for a maximum of 3 times before it marks it as failed.

``--max-retries-count`` can be used along ``--retry-only`` flag. The ``--retry-only`` can be used to filter scenarios that should be retried when failed.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge run --max-retries-count=3 --retry-only="should-retry"

If ``--retry-only`` flag is not specified, all scenarios will retried ``--max-retries-count`` number of times.



Errors during execution
-----------------------

Parse errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This occurs if the spec or concept file doesn't follow the 
expected :ref:`specifications <spec_syntax>` or :ref:`concepts <concept>` syntax.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: text

    [ParseError] hello_world.spec : line no: 25, Dynamic parameter <product> could not be resolved

Validation Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These are errors for which `Gauge` skips executing the spec where the error occurs.

There are two types of validation error which can occurs

    1. Step implementation not found
        If the spec file has a step that does not have an implementation in the projects programming language.
    2. Duplicate step implementation
        If the spec file has a step that is implemented multiple times in the projects.

**Example**

.. code-block:: text

    [ValidationError] login.spec:33: Step implementation not found. login with "user" and "p@ssword"

.. code-block:: text

    [ValidationError] foo.spec:11 Duplicate step implementation => 'Vowels in English language are <table>'


Troubleshooting
===============

Ensure that the latest version of gauge and `gauge plugins <//gauge.org/plugins/>`__. 

Run ``gauge update -c`` to check if there are updates available for gauge and the plugins.

Validation Errors
-----------------

.. code-block:: text

    [WARN] Validation failed. The following steps have errors
    ...

These generally occur if step implementation is not found for a particular step.

- Ensure the :ref:`step implementation <language-steps>` for the step has been added.
- The :ref:`step template <language-steps>` marking the step in code is case sensitive and should match the step usage in the spec file.

Compatibility errors
--------------------

.. code-block:: text

    Failed to start a runner. Compatible runner version to 0.0.7 not found

-  The language plugin installed is not compatible with the gauge version installed.
-  Run ``gauge install language_NAME`` to install the latest compatible version. See :ref:`plugin installation <install_plugins>` for
   more details

Execution Errors
----------------

.. code-block:: text

    Error: too many open files

-  This error occurs when the upper limit to open the number of files is too low. To fix the error, increase the upper limit by adding the command ``ulimit -S -n 2048`` to your ``~/.profile`` file and relogin.
