.. _plugins-installation:

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Plugins are installed using the subcommand ``install``, this checks our plugin
repository and downloads them. ``gauge install <plugin_name>``

**Example:**

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install html-report

To install a specific version of a plugin use the ``--version``
flag.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install html-report --version 2.1.0

To add a plugin to project, issue subcommand ``install`` inside the project, this installs
the plugin and add it to project. If plugin is already installed it just add it to the project i.e.

``gauge install <plugin_name>``

**Example:**

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install xml-report

Offline Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If plugin should be installed from a zip file instead of downloading
from plugin repository, use the ``--file`` or ``-f`` flag.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install html-report --file ZIP_FILE_PATH

Download the latest version of plugin from the ``Releases`` section of
the respective repository. See `plugin list <https://gauge.org/plugins.html>`__ to
find the repositories.

Updating plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To update a plugin to the latest version of it, use the ``update``
subcommand. This downloads the latest plugin from our plugin repository.

``gauge update <plugin_name>``

**Example:**

.. code-block:: console

    gauge update java

To update a plugin to a specific version, use the ``--version``
flag.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge update java --version 0.3.2

You can also update all the installed plugins by running

.. code-block:: console

    gauge update --all
